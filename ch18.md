Infrastructure and tooling are engineer projects; SRE has a product-based mindset and serves internal customers.

SREs at Google are empowered to effectively develop internal tools, because the organization as a whole has a deep understanding of the production environment, and because (since the intended users are fellow SREs) they have access to frank and high-signal user feedback. Well-engineered tools are essential to avoid scaling operations linearly with load.

SREs benefit from the opportunity to perform engineering work, as it allows for career advancement, and because it provides balance against operational work and incident response.

Case study: Auxon, an automated capacity planner for datacenters implemented with mixed-integer linear programming (replacing tedious, error-prone manual bin packing in spreadsheets).

Lessons learned:
- Stay grounded within the production environment; SREs continued working with other teams throughout the 2-year development process.
- Eat your own dogfood; developers were also consumers, giving them a fast feedback loop for feature requests and a strong sense of ownership in the product.
- Ship an MVP, then iterate later; the early versions of Auxon used a "Stupid Solver" that was sufficiently modular to swapped out with a mature framework later.
- Design modularly; rather than building Auxon to automagically modify production, it was designed to emit an agnostic plan that could later be consumed by other tooling.

Tooling must be evangelized and must have good utility in order to achieve traction within an organization. Internal customer service is important.

SRE tools that have a large, highly technical userbase are good candidates to be elevated from one-off tools to full-fledged engineering projects.

SREs tend to be generalists with less experience working on user-facing products; in order to foster a product-focused engineering culture, it might be necessary to partner with engineers with experience on product teams.

Dedicated time for project work is essential in order to prevent SREs from being siloed into operational work. However, an SRE who produces a successful product should not become a full-time product developer embedded inside the SRE organization.

The SRE organization must work hard to ship useful engineering products on a reasonable timeframe in order to maintain credibility, and must not relax software engineering standards or cut corners.
