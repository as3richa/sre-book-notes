"Data loss, data corruption, and extended unavailability are typically indistinguishable to users."

"No one really wants to make backups; what people really want are restores."

"Protecting against a failure at layer X requires storing data on diverse components at that layer.

Defense in depth against data integrity threats: soft deletion, lazy deletion, backups and recovery, replication, early detection.

Google structures backups in tiers: short-lived, quick-to-restore snapshots colocated with the database itself, recent backups on other machines within the same datacenter, less recent backups exported to other datacenters. Storage capacity in later tiers doesn't compete with the growth of the database itself.

Out-of-band data validation pipelines: periodically check the integrity of data in the live production system. Use a tiered system where the most rigorous and expensive validators run more frequently. Factor out the task of maintaining the pipeline to a centralized infrastructure team, because individual product teams lack the bandwidth to build out the infrastructure for themselves.

"Continuously test the data recovery process as part of your normal operations."

DiRT: disaster recovery training exercise.

Checklist of questions for data recovery:
- Are your backups complete and valid, or are they empty?
- Do you have sufficient machines resources to complete the recovery (incl. setup, post-processing, etc.)?
- Does the recovery complete in a reasonable wall time?
- Are you able to monitor the status of the recovery process as it progresses?
- Are you free of critical dependencies on resources outside your control (e.g. cold storage only available during business hours)?

General principles of SRE applied to data integrity: never assume that you understand a complex system well enough to be sure that it won't fail a certain way; trust but verify; apply defense in depth.

Rather than focusing on the means of maintaining/restoring data integrity, demonstrate that your processes actually accomplish the goal.
