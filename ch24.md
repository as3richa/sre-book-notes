title: "Distributed Periodic Scheduling with Chron"

At Google, distributed cron jobs store small volumes of state in the cron service itself, rather than using e.g. GFS, because of latency requirements and in order to avoid a needless dependency on a large component.

The cron service is implemented on top of Paxos, with the Paxos leader also operating as the coordinator (i.e. by starting jobs). Leadership guarantees the mutual exclusion of access to the datacenter scheduler.

In the event of a faillover of the cron leader, some job launches may only have been partially completed. In order to determine that the necessary RPCs were successfully sent and executed by the datacenter scheduler, it must be the case that either all RPCs are idempotent and can safely be retried, or there must be some facility to examine the state of the external systems.
