Launch Coordination Engineering: a consulting team within Google designed to facilitate launches for product teams. LCEs audit the product, sign off on launches, and mediate between the various stakeholders of a launch.

In large organizations, developers aren't necessarily aware of all of the available infrastructure for common tasks (e.g. rate limiting). By converging on a set of common tools and services, the company can eliminate duplicate work and improve knowledge transfer betweenteams and services. The LCE launch checklist is a vehicle for driving teams to use common infrastructure rather than rolling their own solutions.

Techniques for reliable launches:
- Gradual and staged rollouts (canaries, etc.)
- Feature flag frameworks
- Avoid synchronized automatic requests (e.g. downloading updates at exactly 2am)
- Server-controlled client configuration (i.e. client-side feature flags)

In a simple model, one might assume that the performance of a service is linear as a function of load, but in reality, underloaded services are often slower because of cold caches, and heavily loaded servers may have non-linear performance (e.g. JVM GC pressure).

The LCE workload is reduced by categorizing low-risk launches (e.g. no new servers, small increase in traffic) and giving them a much smaller checklist to work through.

If the underlying infrastructure for a service is under active development, the product team has to invest effort in order to keep up the resulting changes (e.g. updating configuration files, rebuilding binaries, etc.). In order to prevent churn for product teams, infrastructure teams may be barred from releasing breaking changes until they've automated the migration process.
