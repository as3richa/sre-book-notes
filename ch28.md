title: "Accelerating SREs to On-Call and Beyond"
authors: ["Andrew Widdowson"]

"How can my existing on-callers assess the readiness of the newbie for on-call? How can we harness the enthusiasm and curiosity in our new hires to make sure that existing SREs benefit from it? What activities can I commit our team to that benefit everyone's education, but that everyone will like?"

Recommended patterns for SRE education:
- Design concrete curricula for students to follow
- Encourage thinking from fundamental principles
- Celebrate the analysis of failure rather than pretending it doesn't happen
- Create contained, but realistic, breakages for students to fix
- Role-play disasters a team
- Encouraging students to shadow their on-call primary and compare notes
- Pair students with experts to revise the training plan
- Allocate non-trivial projects for new SREs, so that they can gain partial ownership of the stack

Anti-patterns of SRE education:
- Don't teach by menial work (e.g. ticket triaging)
- Train through practice rather than simply reading docs
- Encourage post-mortem analysis rather than burying outages
- Give new SREs the oppotunity to fix something before they're the primary on-call
- Don't silo knowledge w.r.t. on-call into individual experts
- Don't push new SREs into on-call before they have a holistic understanding of the service
- Don't award new project work exclusively to senior engineers

"Put some amount of learning order into your system(s) so that your new SREs see a path before them. Any type of training is better than random tickets and interrupts."

Having a sense of ownership in the system improves learning outcomes, so assign meaningful projects that induce a sense of ownership. Also, by completing non-trivial work, a new SRE gains the trust of his senior colleagues.

"Being too procedural in the face of an outage, thus forgetting your analytical skills, can be the difference between getting stuck and findinf the root cause."

Being on-call is not necessarily the most useful role an SRE can take on, but "ready for on-call" is a good proxy for a "knows enough and can figure out the rest".

Five practices for aspiring on-callers:
- Read, share, and discuss post-mortems
- Role-play mock disasters
- Break and fix real servers (e.g. inject a fault, predict the resulting degradation)
- Maintain an on-call learning checklist (which must be internalized before a new hire can proceed to shadowing an on-call)
- Shadow on-call early and often

Considering CCing newbies on pages during business hours; their curiosity will direct them to learn about the system and its failure modes.

Shadow on-call shifts induce comfort and trust in senior teammates with the idea of the new SRE going on-call. Don't dump the task of writing a post-mortem onto the junior, because this instills the false notion that post-mortems are grunt work.
