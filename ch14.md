Everyone involved in an incident must have a well-defined role, and must not stray into someone else's role. By clearly delineating roles, each individual has more autonomy, because they don't need to second-guess their colleagues.

The incident commander holds the high-level state about the incident. They structure the incident response task force, assigning responsibility to colleagues; implicitly, they are responsible for any position that they haven't explicitly delegated.

The ops lead works with the incident commander by applying operational tools to the task at hand. Nobody other than the operations team should be modifying the system during the incident.

One person should take on the task of communicating, e.g. by sending email updates to relevant stakeholders, updating status pages, recording the timeline of events in a document, etc. Another should take on a planning or logistical role, by filing bugs, arranging handoffs, ordering dinner, etc.

Communication w.r.t. the ongoing incident should take place in a physical or virtual war room. The commander should maintain a "live incident state" document, e.g. a Google Doc specifying the timeline, etc. Handoffs should be clear and explicit to everyone involved.

Regularly put the incident management plan to use, in roleplay or in non-critical situations, in order to maintain familiarity.
