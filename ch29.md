title: "Dealing with Interrupts"

Recall that operational load falls into three categories: pages (i.e. production emergencies), tickets (i.e. non-urgent events or requests for which action is required), and ongoing operational activities (i.e. toil).

Pages are routed to a single on-call engineer, in order to minimize interruptions to the team as a whole, and to avoid the bystander effect (in which individuals are less compelled to help because others are present).

Cognitive flow: being "in the zone" can increase productivity and creativity, but interrupts can take one out of the zone. However, when the goal in itself is to handle interrupts, interrupts cease to be interrupts; fixing problems and whacking tickets becomes a clear set of goals, boundaries and feedback, allowing one to achieve flow. When you're handling interrupts, project work is a distraction.

Polarize time: on any given day, know whether you're doing just project work, or just interrupt handling.

If taking the on-call off project work for a week would be too costly, that person shouldn't be on-call.

Don't assign tickets at random to members of the team; dedicate a full-time role to handling them for a manageable period of time (e.g. week-long rotations).

Don't assign indefinite, ongoing responsibility for e.g. a push to the on-call at the time of the request; formalize a handoff procedure such that the next on-call can take over the responsibility once the first on-call's rotation comes to an end.

Don't silo knowledge or skills such that an engineer not on-call absolutely must take on an interrupt.

Don't treat the ticket queue as a gauntlet to be ran through every few months; work to investigate tickets at a deeper level, maintaining state and sharing knowledge between consecutive on-calls, with the aim of reducing the influx of tickets.

Be willing to push back on user requests through policy; remember that, if the customer wants a certain task to be accomplished, they should be prepared to spend some effort getting what they want.
