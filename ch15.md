Incidents and outages are inevitable given (Google's) scale and velocity of changes. A structured process for learning from outages is required to prevent them from reoccuring.

Goals of a postmortem:
- Ensure that the incident is documented
- Ensure that all contributing root causes are well-understood
- Ensure that effective preventative measures are put in place to reduce the likelihood of a reoccurance and the impact thereof

Blameless postmortems focus on identifying causes rather than indicting particular teams or individuals. "Blameful" postmortems discourage transparency and education because they discourage people from bringing issues to light. You can't fix people, but you can fix processes.

Ideally, postmortem documents are constructed in a real-time collaborative environment with commenting/annotations, e.g. Google Docs. Complete postmortem documents should be shared company-wide on a mailing list.

At Google, a postmortem culture is cultivated by active participation of management in the postmortem process, as well as events for postmortem discussion and exercises. Employees should be visibly rewarded for well-executed postmortems.
