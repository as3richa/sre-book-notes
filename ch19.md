Returning multiple A/AAAA records isn't a good solution for DNS-based load balancing, because it doesn't allow fine-grained control, e.g. clients will typically pick an address at random rather than picking a geographically close address, or a more idle DC, etc.

Recursive resolvers make it difficult to select the optimal IP address for a given client, because typically the authorotative nameservers would see the IP address of the ISP's recursive resolver rather than the real IP of the client. Also, ISP resolvers would typically cache the returned IP and yield it for all incoming DNS lookups for the duration of the TTL. To mitigate this, Google attempts to track the size and geographical distribution of the userbase of any particular recursive resolver, allowing the IP address of an appropriately-located DC to be yielded for that recursive resolver.

All this being said, DNS load balancing is not sufficient on its own; DNS load balancing must be followed by a layer that takes advantage of virtual IP addresses.

VIP implementations put many servers behind an opaque network load balancer, which forwards incoming packets to some server. Clients are agnostic to the existence of many machines for the same addresss. Intuitively it seems that the best load balancing solution would simply be to forward packets to the least loaded machine, but of course this breaks down immediately for stateful protocols (e.g. TCP); packets from the same session must be forwarded to the same backend.

Consistent hashing allows a backend server to be assigned to any given incoming connection, without causing a catastrophic rebalancing in the case that a machine is added or removed from the VIP's rotation. Typically, a simple connection-to-machine mapping can be maintained in memory, but (when the VIP is under stress and the mapping grows prohibitively large) consistent hashing can be used as a fallback.

In order to deliver packets to the correct machine, the VIP load balancer can use Network Address Translation to modify the MAC address only and deliver the packet to the backend with source and destination IP address intact, and the machine can subsequently respond directly to the client ("Direct Server Response"). If requests are small in comparison to responses, the vast majority of data can avoid traversing the load balancer. However, this solution requires that every backend machine is reachable by any other at the data link layer; Google has long since exceeded the scalability of this approach.

Google VIPs currently use packet encapsulation. Incoming packets are wrapped with Generic Routing Encapsulation and forwarded to the correct backend, which strips off the GRE header and processes the packet as if it was delivered directly. The space overhead induced by GRE can cause packet fragmentation.
