At Google, individual services implement a `/varz` HTTP endpoint, which exposes internal statistics in a simple plain-text format. Per-service, per-cluster Borgmon processes periodically scrape `/varz` from all servers of the relevant service, storing each metric as a time-series list in memory. Data is periodically flushed to an external store (TSDB).

Almost all statistics in Borgmon are simple counters. Gauges can be problematic, because spikes between sampling intervals may be missed.

Each time-series has a set of labels, e.g. variable name, job, service, datacenter. Borgmon allows querying for metrics by label and by time. Borgmon rules are simple algebraic expressions on time-series, each rule itself inducing a time-series. Aggregation (summing across some label, e.g. cluster or job) is a core concept for distributed monitoring.

Alerts are specified as expressions in the same languages as rules (e.g. fire if some time-series exceeds some threshold). Alerts are considered to be pending if their rule expression holds, but only fire after a short duration in order to prevent flapping. Alerts are dispatched by Borgmon via Alertmanager, which pages the on-call or enqueues tickets according to the relevant team's configuration.

Borgmon can be composed in a hierarchy via a streaming protocol (i.e. a small set of global Borgmon can aggregate data for a service from the set of per-cluster Borgmon).

`/varz` and Borgmon fulfill the need for white-box monitoring. Google's solution for black-box monitoring is Prober, a service which runs protocol checks against a given service, reporting success or failure. Prober can be configured to validate response content and to extract and export data from responses (e.g. to generate a histogram of response time), and be pointed at either internal load balancers or at the externally visible frontend domain.

Borgmon configuration separates rules from the monitored service, allowing common rules to be reused across many different services. Configuration has extensive unit and regression testing.

"Ensuring that the cost of maintenance scales sublinearly with the size of the service is key to making monitoring maintainable."
