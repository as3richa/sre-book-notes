Strategies for preparedness in the face of disaster:
- Relentless organizational focus on safety ("every management meeting started with a discussion of safety")
- Attention to detail ("the nuclear Navy focuses on routine maintenance to ensure that small issues don't snowball")
- Swing capacity (i.e. extra capacity to be used in the case of an unexpected spike)
- Simulations and live drills (e.g. staged drownings for lifeguards)
- Training and certification
- Obsessive focus on detailed requirements and design
- Defense in depth

The risk appetites, regulatory requirements, etc. differs between a company serving websites vs. e.g. a company producing EKG machines.

Differing industries have different motivations for engaging in post-mortems: regulatory requirements (FCC, FAA, etc.), safety concerns for workers (chemical manufacturing), and loss of life of consumers. In some industries preemptive post-mortems for "near misses") are also undertaken ("there are multiple near misses in just about every disaster").

"In the field, it's not helpful to place blame on a single individual."

Attitudes towards automation are mixed. For example, nuclear submarines require four crewmen to complete the process of opening a single valve, the rationale being that an automated system might not spot a problem that would be obvious to a human. Laser eye surgery, on the other hand, implemented automatic safety features to match parameters to patients, thereby eliminating an entire class of medical errors.

Requirements for rational decision making:
- The basis for the decision is agreed upon in advance rather than justified after the fact
- The inputs to the decision are clear, and any assumptions are explicitly stated
- Data-driven decisions win over decisions based on feelings

Many industries focus heavily on procedure rather than ad hoc problem solving. Every failure mode is documented in the "binder", and the binder dictates precisely how to react. This model works well in slow-moving industries where the things that can go wrong are not constantly evolving.

"The ability to move or change quickly must be weighed against the differing implications of a failure."
