At Google:
- SREs spend at most 25% of their time on-call.
- The maximum number of incidents per 12 hour shift is 2; if this limit is exceeded, corrective measures must be taken to improve the health of the service.
- Engineers on the rotation are compensated in either time off or straight cash, with a cap in compensation preventing excessive time on-call.
- For sufficiently large teams, multi-site teams are preferred to eliminate the need for night shifts.

In order to prevent impulsive, unreasoned decision making in incident response, measures have to be taken in order to alleviate stress associated with the on-call role:
- Clear escalation paths
- Well-defined incident management procedures
- A culture of blameless post-mortems

Google implements tooling for coordinating external communication, handing off responsibility, etc. in order to allow incident managers to focus on the task at hand.

Paging alerts should be aligned with the service's SLO (i.e. an on-call engineer shouldn't be bothered by non-urgent alerts w.r.t. the SLO). Closely-related alerts should be grouped such that only a single alert fires for a single incident; this allows the incident manager to focus on the incident rather than on triaging.

Every SRE should have the opportunity to go on-call at least once or twice per quarter, in order to maintain a baseline level of familiarity with the production system.
