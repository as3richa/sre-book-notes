Unit tests assert the behaviour in isolation of a single separable component of a program, e.g. a class or function. Integration tests assert that larger, "assembled" components behave as expected, possibly using dependency injection frameworks to mock out complex external dependencies. System tests assert functionality of the system as a whole (but without deploying the system into production); smoke tests assert simple-yet-essential functionality of the system; regression tests assert that previously-fixed bugs haven't been reintroduced into the system.

Production tests interact with a live production system rather than an instance spun up in a test environment. Staged rollouts (e.g. canaries, multiple concurrent version, etc.) can complicate the situation for production testing.

SRE tools need test suites too.

Ideally, tests should be run only against dependent components of a given changed component.

Production tests can be used as healthchecks to prevent new, buggy servers from serving live traffic.

Multiple revisions of the same service can be running in production at any given moment; for instance, both an old and new version of a frontend server could be hitting (at random) both old and new versions of a backend service. Production tests can assert that all four combinations of revisions are interoperating correctly. Ideally, rollout automation should prevent e.g. a service with a dependency on a very recent backend from being deployed alongside an old version of the backend.
