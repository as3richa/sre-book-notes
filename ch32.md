Few services begin their lives with SRE support; the onboarding process dictates how SRE evaluates a service to determine if it merits SRE support, how to fix any blockers to support, and how SRE actually begins supporting the service.

Ideally, by engaging SRE sooner, the service can be shipped more reliably out of the gate. Alternatively, the process can be short-circuited entirely by providing product development teams with a platform of SRE-validated infrastructure upon which they can build their systems.

SRE is concerned with:
- System architecture and interservice dependencies
- Instrumentation, metrics, and monitoring
- Emergency response
- Capacity planning
- Change management
- Performance (availability, latency, efficiency)

When SREs engage with a service, they aim to improve it along all axes.

Not all services at Google receive close attention from SRE. Some don't need high reliability or availability, and moreover the number of teams requesting support exceeds the total bandwidth of SRE by design. The needs of these services can be served through documentation and guidelines w.r.t. the production environment, and through sporadic consultation with SRE teams (e.g. for launches). Services that did not receive close SRE attention but that grew significantly may be taken under the wing of an SRE team.

When a development team requests that SRE take over production management of their service, SRE weighs the importance of the service against the bandwidth of SRE. If it's decided that the service merits SRE support, SRE initiates a Production Readiness Review.

The goals of the PRR are:
- Verify that the service meets standards of production and operational readiness, and that the service owners are prepared to work with SRE\
- Improve the reliability of the service in production; minimize the number and severity of incidents

When the service is deemed ready, an SRE team assumes its production responsibilities.

Simple PRR model: targeted at an already-launched service to be taken over by an SRE team.

Steps of Simple PRR:
- Engagement: a small group of SREs initiates discussion with the development team w.r.t. SLOs, planning for design changes to improve reliability, and training schedules, the goal being to arrive at a common agreement about the process, end goals, and outcomes that are necessary to shift production onto SRE
- Analysis: SRE examines the design and maturity of the service w.r.t. its production concerns in order to determine whether the service follows best practices and what improvements need to be made
- Improvements and refactoring: improvements from the previous step are prioritized, discussed, and implemented by both SRE and the product development team
- Training: the SREs who led the PRR take ownership of training the rest of the SRE team in undestanding and operating the service
- Onboarding: responsibility and ownership of various aspects of production are gradually transferred to the SRE team, with the development team remaining available to advise
- Continuous improvement: SRE maintains the reliability standards of the service in the face of evolving features and system dependencies

Early Engagement: PRR conducted as early as possible in the development cycle of the service. It is necessary to identify candidates for EE based on the business value, scale, and complexity of the service (e.g. a service adding functionality to an existing SRE-managed system, a rewrite of a previous large service, etc.). SREs are immersed in the development process of the service, operating with the same focus as in the Simple PRR model.

EE is useful in that SRE has a say in early design decisions and can recommend best practices, libraries, tools, etc., yielding greater reliability early in the system's life and reducing the need for costly or difficult design changes to a live production service.

A structural solution: implement a platform or framework of reusable solutions and best practices for common reliability and scalability problems. Benefits:
- Best practices are codified; implementing best practices and being production-ready is as simple as "use the framework"
- Less duplicate work across services
- Every service has the same operational control surfaces, logging, monitoring, etc.
- Easier automation across services
- Developers can self-service, and their effort is freed to work on application-level concerns
- Dramatically reduced review burden for onboarding by SREs
- Services implemented on top of the framework benefit from incremental improvements made to the framework over time
