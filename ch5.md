title: "Eliminating Toil"
authors: ["Vivek Rau"]

"If a human operator needs to touch your system during normal operations, you have a bug."

Toil is manual, repetitive, automatable work devoid of enduring value (vs. engineering: novel work that intrinsically requires human judgement and which yields permanent improvement in a service).

"You can't make a career out of grunge."

Toil sets negative precedent, e.g. by encouraging dev teams to foist operational work onto SRE.
