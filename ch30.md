title: "Embedding an SRE to Recover from Operational Overload"
authors: ["Randall Bosetti"]

When SREs spend too much time on toil and less time on improving the service, performance and reliability suffer.

If a team is spending too much time on tickets, an SRE may be embedded in order to observe and improve the team's practices.

Phase 1 of an embedding: learn the service and get context. "Your job while embedded with the team is to articulate why processes and habits contribute to, or detract from, the service's scalability".

More tickets shouldn't require more SREs; processes should be simplified and automated as much as possible. In general, the engineer workload shouldn't scale linearly with the size of the service.

Rather than focusing on how to quickly resolve incidents, work to reduce their frequency.

Identify emergencies in the making:
- Knowledge gaps (i.e. overspecialization) within the team
- Implicitly relying on solutions coming in the future
- Common alerts going undiagnosed
- Lack of capacity planning
- Post-mortems where the only action item was a rollback
- Critical components that aren't well understood by the SREs

Phase 2: sharing context. Lay the groundwork for improvement by educating the team w.r.t. best practices (e.g. post-mortems) and by finding pain points in terms of toil. Partition incidents into toil and not-tail; explain why and how the resolutions for toilsome incidents should be automated.

Phase 3: driving change. Work to build a healthy mental model of SRE within the team.

Write an SLO for the service if one doesn't already exist, because it gives an objective, quantitative of the impact of an outage.

Don't simply fix the technical issues you've identified, because this instills the feeling that "making changes is for other people". Isolate an issue that can be addressed by a single team member, explain clearly how it would address the root cause of a previous incident, and serve as the reviewer for the necessary changes.

Explain the reasoning behind your suggested. "After you leave, the team should be able to predict what your comment on a design or changelist would be." Ask questions that encourage people to think about the basic principles (e.g. "how do these untriaged alerts impact the SLO?").
