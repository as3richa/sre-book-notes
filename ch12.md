The hypothetico-deductive method: given a set of observations about a system and a theoretical basis for understanding system behavior, iteratively hypothesize potential causes for a failure and try to test those hypotheses. Triage, examine, diagnose, test/treat, repeat.

Common pitfalls of troubleshooting:
- Misunderstanding system metrics or examining the wrong symptoms
- Misunderstanding how to change the system in order to safely check a hypothesis
- Hypothesizing improbable theories, or latching onto a previous cause of problems
- Hunting down spurious correlations that are either coincidental or that share a common cause

Effective problem reports specify the expected behaviour, the actual behaviour, and (ideally) steps with which the problem can be reproduced. Google teams have bespoke bug reporting forms; reporting bugs to individual team members is an anti-pattern, because it silos problem-solving onto a small subset of the team.

In the face of an incident, the first impulse is to start troubleshooting and find the root cause as quickly as possible; however, the correct course of action is to make the system as functional as possible under the circumstance. This might entail emergency response such as diverting traffic or shedding load.

"A malfunctioning system is often still trying to do something - just not the thing you want it to be doing", e.g. a service becoming unresponsive because it's stuck evaluating a bad regex.

"Recent changes to a system can be a productive place to start identifying what's going wrong."
