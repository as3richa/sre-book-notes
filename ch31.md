Production meeting: a weekly meeting in which an SRE team carefully articulates to itself and to its invitees the state of their service in order to increase general awareness among everyone who cares.

Production meetings are service oriented (i.e. they aren't about the status updates of individual engineers). The details of the performance of the service are discussed and related to the design, configuration, and implementation of the service; connecting performance with design decisions is a powerful feedback loop.

There are many ways to run a production meeting; there's no prescriptive agenda. Some topics of interest:
- Upcoming production changes
- System metrics
- Outages (post-mortems)
- Paging events (should that alert have paged the way it did? Should it have paged at all?)
- Non-paging events (should that alert have paged? What work is in progress to address the alert? Does the alert require attention at all?)
- Prior action items

Attendance should be compulsory for all members of the SRE team; major stakeholders and product developers should also attend. If your relationship with the product team is such that you cannot invite them, you need to fix that relationship (e.g. by inviting a single representative from the team).

Team composition: SRE teams have the roles of tech lead (TL), manager (SRM), and project manager (PM, TPM, PgM). The tech lead is responsible for the technical direction of the team. Tech leads can do almost all of the manager's job (because managers are highly technical), but managers have the responsibility of performance management, and of being a catch-all for unhandled tasks.

Case study: Viceroy, an SRE-owned monitoring dashboard framework developed in order to prevent individual teams from reinventing their own dashboards on every new project. By unifying the effort into a single piece of infrastructure, a better solution was delivered at a much higher velocity.

The cross-site nature of the Viceroy project lead to some difficulties in communication among remote teammates. Also, because of churn in the set of developers working on Viceroy, features tended to be delivered, abandoned, and droppped.

Lessons:
- Working cross-site is costly in terms of latency and communications overhead, but can induce much higher throughput
- Contributors must be committed to the project (i.e. not just trying to earn a notch on their belt) in order to avoid derelict features
- Project leaders are important in order to provide a long-term vision, alignment of work, and prioritization
- The team must have an agreed-upon way of making decisions
- One can divide and conquer across sites by breaking the project into self-contained components (but recall Conway's law: software has the same structure as the org chart)
- "A goal for a project team works best when it's oriented towards providing some functionality or solving some problem"; this ensures that expectations and criteria for completion are clear
- Write things down (design documents and reviews, etc.)
- Standards are important; in the event of an unreconcileable disagreement, find an arbitrator, and codify their decision as a standard moving forward
- There's no substitute for in-person interaction; consider organizing a summit

Collaboration outside SRE: the best time for collaboration between product and SRE is early in the design process, before any code has been written.
