Outalator is Google's outage tracker.  It passively receives all alerts sent by the monitoring infrastructure in order to analyze the resultant data. This is a complement to postmortems, because e.g. certain recurring issues are not dire enough to ever induce a full outage, but still negatively impact the health of the platform as a whole.

Outalator allows alerts to be annotated, and allows multiple alerts to be grouped together as a single incident. Alerts can be tagged with e.g. a bug tracker issue ID, a label indicating a false positive, a label indicating the faulty component, etc.
