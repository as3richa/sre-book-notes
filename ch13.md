Don't panic; if you can't think of a solution, cast a wider net and pull in more of your teammates.

Involve the person who may have triggered the incident.

Test proactively rather than waiting for things to break.

Perform post-mortem analysis and work to ensure that the problem cannot happen again; hold yourself and your teammates accountable for completing this work.

Document failure modes for posterity.
